### Project Title
bikeshare system - python

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price.

This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride.

This program shows you the statistics of the most popular 3 cities dataset in US.
Three of the dataset contains the below 6 columns.
  - Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
  - End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
  - Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
  - Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
  - End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
  - User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
